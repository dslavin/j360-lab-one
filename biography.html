		<p>Blair Waldorf is the daughter of fashion icon, Eleanor Waldorf. She has the grace and beauty of classic Hollywood actresses but idolizes strong, powerful women. Blair is a driven woman who is used to getting what she desires by any means necessary.</p>

		<p>Blair is one of the main focuses in Gossip Girl's blog. She is referenced by her initial, "B" or her Gossip Girl nickname, "Queen B," because of her strong influence and social grasp on her rich and popular clan she handpicked to do her bidding while attending Constance Billiard school in Manhattan.</p>

		<p>She struggles with her urge to constantly be on top but is insecure of her best friend Serena van der Woodsen's carefree ease when it comes to life. In many episodes Blair has found herself in humbling positions after executing well-planned schemes to destroy other characters.</p>

		<p>Another focal point of the show is her on and off relationship with Chuck Bass. Throughout the show the two of them overcome various obstacles such as relationships with other people and social standing.</p>
